        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Maya Serna. I am a second year student at the University of California Riverside, studying Art History and Business Administration. My grade point average is a three point five. I am set to graduate in the spring of twenty twenty six. My future goal is to work in museum management. 

I am nineteen years old, and my birthday is June 24, 2004. I am very skilled in communication and working well with others. I have worked previously at Yougurt Mill, Kung-Fu Tea, and UC Riverside Campus Tours. I am currently a Resident Advisor living on campus at UC Riverside in the Pentland Hills Residence Halls. 

After I graduate from UC Riverside with my bachelors degree I intend to apply to a masters program after graduation to earn my masters degree in art history. A masters degree is the minimum requirement for most well paying museum jobs. 

<br><br>

        
During my previous jobs at Yogurt Mill and Kung-Fu Tea I gained skills like time management, positive attitude, goal focused, ability to work well with others, following instructions, conversing with customers. My responsibilities in my previous jobs mainly consisted of forming relationships with customers, taking customer orders, fulfilling customer orders, processing payments, maintaining sanitation within the store, handling disputes, and keeping the team morale high. During my time working for UC Riverside Campus Tours, my responsibilities included, interacting with customers, answering phones, booking appointments, cancelling appointments, taking people out on tours, memorizing information, answering questions, memorizing information, and writing tour scripts. 

I worked at Yogurt Mill from October 2020 until September 2021. After that I worked at Kung-fu Tea from September 2021 until August 2022. Next I worked at UC Riverside Campus Tours from March 2023 until September 2023. These experiences have made me a well rounded employee who is able to adjust to different types of positions. 
<br><br>

        In the upcoming year I have multiple goals that I am working towards that will help me develop as a person. One of my goals is to improve my interpersonal skills. This I can improve by putting myself out there and joining in on social situations that are outside of my comfort zone. Another one of my goals for this year is to land an internship at a museum. This can be achieved by me applying for as many available positions as possible and improving my resume in order to make my application appear more professional. My other goal for this year is to set better habits within my life. These habits involve eating better, sleeping more, and doing my work on time. I intend to make a calendar using google calendar and adding my classes to it, my appointments, my assignments, and other important tasks. I believe that if I am able to stay focused and commit myself to my goals I will be able to achieve them. 

After reading this description I hope that you have learned about me, and are interested in knowing even more about my life. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
